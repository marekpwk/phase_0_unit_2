# I've use delete_if method, which takes the block, and deletes element when block evaluates to true.
# Second method I've used is to_s which converst an element to a string
# Third method I've used is include? which returns true  if string contains the given string or character

# Reflect!
# While researching  this assignment, I decided to use just Ruby documentation, and no other Internet research. I browsed through Array,
# Hash and Enumerable methods and it probably took much longer than just simply googling  them,
# but along the way I got familiar with many other methods. Although I don't remember most of it,
# I still think it was beneficial to me and I will go through documentation first, and then search the Internet for help.
